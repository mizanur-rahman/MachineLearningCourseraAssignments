Implementing machine learning algorithms (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning) from scratch in MATLAB and gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.
